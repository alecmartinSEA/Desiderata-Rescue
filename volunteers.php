    <h3>Help us to save lives!</h3>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a Desiderata Rescue Volunteer!  We are a volunteer-run organization and are always looking for new volunteers to help make a difference.
</p>
    <p>
We appreciate any amount of time or skill/expertise you are willing to share with us. In addition to fostering and donating, we primarily need people to…</p>
    <p>Mid-week Tasks</p>
    
        <p><strong>Transport animals to or from foster homes, veterinary appointments, boarding facilities and XXX in the Puget Sound area.<br />
Visit the facilities where our dogs or cats board to walk them and/or interact with them.</strong>  
</p>
<p>Marketing/Promotion:</p>       
<p>Help promote adoptions and fostering by posting pictures or sharing our updates<br />
Help plan various fund raising events & come up with event ideas of your own<br />
Contact friends and businesses to see if they would donate services to our rescue<br />
Contact media outlets to pitch stories about Desiderata and our animals<br />
Make a video of our animals and share in the same ways listed above<br />
Use your artistic or graphic design skills to help us design flyers, marketing materials, t-shirts, posters, or any other projects we may have.  Please contact us and we will let you know if we have any current needs!<br />
    Help us to recruit more volunteers and fosters for the animals<br />
    <p>Operations:</p>
        <p>Keep track of supplies<br />
Answer emails to desideratarescue@gmail.com<br />
Research and apply for grants available to Desiderata</p>
<p>Fundraising/Donations: </p>
        <p><strong>Organize an independent fundraiser such as a bake sale, garage sale, car wash, raffle, auction, or anything else that would raise funds for the animals</strong></p>
<p>Volunteering isn’t only about spending time with the animals (though it is the best part!). If you have an expertise that you would be willing to offer, such as accounting practices, fundraising skills, promotion experience, legalese, a training background or even something that may seem far-fetched, please let us know.</p>
        <p>If you have any other questions about volunteering you can email us at desideratarescue@gmail.com.  Thanks again for helping animals in need!</p>
