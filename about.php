    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Desiderata translates to ‘something needed or wanted’. Spearheaded by rescue founder, Miriam Kelly, Desiderata is a new rescue located in Seattle, Washington with a focus on heartworm positive dogs who stand almost no chance of being adopted in over-crowded shelters.

We treat them and then adopt them out. We also rescue cats and kittens, as well as heartworm negative dogs.

While we rescue mostly out of Texas shelters, we adopt and find fosters for our dogs and cats out of the Greater Puget Sound area.

We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

<h4>Desiderata Rescue is dedicated to the following goals:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Rescuing stray animals from animal shelters (mostly in Texas) who have not been adopted and are scheduled to be euthanized. Desiderata takes the animals who have been in the shelters the longest and will die unless rescued.</li>
        <li>Providing medical care to neglected, abused and injured animals.</li>
        <li>Rehabilitating hard-to-adopt animals and finding them loving homes.</li>
        <li>Promoting the importance of spaying and neutering pets in order to drastically reduce the number of unwanted animals on the street.</li>
        <li>Ultimately, securing a boarding facility or foster family where rescued pets can be safely sheltered without the threat of euthanization until we find adoptive parents for them.</li>
    </ul>
