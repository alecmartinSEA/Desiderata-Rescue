    <h3>Foster</h3>
    <p>Desiderata Rescue is desperately in need of fosters!  Please read the information below about fostering a Desiderata dog or cat, or email desiderataresuce@gmail.com with any questions. </p>
    <p>Already know you want to foster? If you have already downloaded and read our foster application form, please email Miriam at desideratarescue@gmail.com and note your interest in fostering in the subject line. </p>
    <p>Miriam will follow up with you by sending an official form via DocuSign for you to sign and return. </p>
    <p>Becoming a foster parent is rewarding and easy!  All it takes is filling out an application and, if approved, a volunteer will visit your home for a brief home check to get to you know better. </p>
    <p>Our goal is to match a foster animal with you and your lifestyle that will be mutually beneficial.  By taking an animal into your home on a temporary basis, the animal is given an opportunity to adjust to a home environment, and we are given additional time to find a permanent home.</p>
    <p>Please read our complete FAQ if you have any questions about our process, our rescue or our animals. Or, see the Foster FAQ below for information that only pertains to fostering. </p>
<p>If you still have questions, feel free to email us at desideratarescue@gmail.com. </p>
        <p><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are the costs associated with fostering a pet?</strong> </p>
<p>Desiderata Rescue pays the cost of all veterinary care, transportation, food and other supplies the dog or cat may need. </p>

        <p><strong>How long am I expected to foster?</strong></p>
<p>We prefer that you commit to fostering your animal until an adoptive home can be found. Unfortunately, we cannot predict how long this will take. It depends on the animal’s breed, age, temperament, and the time of year, as well as how proactive you are about marketing your foster animal and attending adoption events. If you can only foster for a specific period of time, please be certain to indicate this up front on your application. Sometimes another foster home can’t be found, which means that your animal must go to a boarding facility. We prefer to avoid boarding animals because it’s both expensive for Desiderata and stressful for the animal. Still, if you find you cannot continue fostering your animal, contact Desiderata Rescue immediately.</p>

        <p><strong>What if my foster pet isn’t working out?</strong> </p>
<p>Desiderata Rescue will make every effort to ensure a good and safe foster match. However, there are times when this will fail. In this case, contact us as soon as possible. If the issues are minor, we will work with you to address them. Many times, problems can be solved by trying a few new things and/or by giving the animal time to adjust to your home. For example, we can switch crates, switch foods, or offer simple behavioral solutions to try. Other times, an animal may simply not be a good fit for your home or lifestyle. Desiderata Rescue will always take the foster animal back if an issue cannot be resolved. However, we ask that you give us at least 24 hours to make a plan. If that is not possible, we will make emergency arrangements. We never want to put the safety of the foster family, their own animals, or the foster animal in jeopardy.</p>

        <p><strong>Do I get to choose which dog or cat I foster?</strong> </p>
<p>We try to match the foster pet to the home it will be going to. If you require a particular size, or if you need a dog who is good with children or other pets, we do our best to meet that criteria. We encourage the foster home to meet the prospective dog or cat before bringing it home to ensure a good match.</p>

    <p><strong>What is required of the foster family during the pet’s stay? </strong></p>
<p>As a foster, you are not responsible for any of the costs associated with veterinary care, treatments or transportation.</p>
        <p><strong>Below is a list of what you are responsible for:</strong></p> 
        
<p>Weekly updates via pictures, email, text, etc.<br />
Home visits to ensure pet’s safety and care.<br />
Transportation to the vet for appointments and check-ups?<br />
Regular outings <br />
Certain food? They are not given the food<br />
Require you have a home XX size, a yard, etc.?</p>
      

        <p><strong>What if I have to go out of town while I’m fostering?</strong> </p>
<p>Please notify us ahead of time so that we can make arrangements for your foster animal to go elsewhere while you are gone. Some foster people (who have other pets) have dog sitters who will also watch their foster dog. Other foster volunteers like to travel with their foster dog. Others may have a boarding facility they work with. We are open to ideas, but generally cannot afford to cover the costs of dog sitters or expensive boarding facilities. If you wish to pay for these options once they are approved, that is great (and can be considered a donation)! If you cannot, we will allow you to make arrangements either with one of our boarding partners or with another foster volunteer. Be sure to give us enough warning so that we can help you make these arrangements. Keep in mind that holidays can be difficult to find space and are expensive. The more advance time we have, the better!</p>

        <p><strong>Am I involved in my foster pet’s adoption?</strong> </p>
<p>We have found that foster homes are the best judge of what kind of home is the best fit for their foster dog’s particular needs. You will be involved in the screening process of potential adopters, in order to find the best home for the dog or cat. </p>

        <p><strong>Can I adopt my foster pet?</strong></p>
<p>Even if you have been fostering the pet you would like to adopt, you are still required to pay an adoption fee of $300 - $500.</p>


        <p><strong>I am unable to foster, how can I help Desiderata Rescue? </strong></p>
<p>Donate money to help with transport, vet costs and other treatments. We have a YouCaring donation page set up here, or you can donate directly to Desiderata Rescue through our PayPal account, using the desideratarescue@gmail.com email address. <br />
Volunteer your time! We are always looking for help with administrative work, social media, website maintenance, dog trainers, PR/media outreach, graphic or web design, legalese, etc. If you can think of any skills or expertise that would be beneficial to our rescue, let us know, we’d love to hear from you! <br />
Create posters, flyers, brochures and distribute them in your school or community bulletins in order to bring awareness to our mission.<br />
Educate others on the issue/share our message! Every time we post to Facebook, we are trying to save a life. If you can re-share across your own networks, the chances of us saving one more life are that much better. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Are my donations or costs for fostering tax deductible?</strong></p>
<p>Purchases made for foster care may be considered donations to the shelter and would be tax-deductible. Please check with your shelter or rescue group regarding their tax-deductible status. If the organization is a non-profit, keep your receipts.</p>

        <p><strong>Okay, I’m interested in fostering, what are the next steps? </strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in fostering through Desiderata Rescue, please email Miriam at desiderataresuce@gmail.com in order to be sent an official foster application via DocuSign. Once you have filled out the application – and are approved - we will follow up with you for any questions and to schedule a home visit.   </p>
